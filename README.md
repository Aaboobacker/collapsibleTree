Overview
--------

collapsibleTree is an R htmlwidget that allows you to create interactive collapsible Reingoldâ€“Tilford tree diagram using D3.js. Turn your data frame into a hierarchical visualization without worrying about nested lists or JSON objects!

If you're using Shiny, you can bind the most recently clicked node to a Shiny input, allowing for easier interaction with complex nested objects. The input will return a named list containing the most recently selected node, as well as all of its parents. See the Shiny example for more info.

### Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("AdeelK93/collapsibleTree")
```

### Usage

When working with data in R, it makes sense (at least to me) to represent everything as a data frame. I'm a big fan of [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html), but this structure does not lend itself to easily designing hierarchical networks.

collapsibleTree uses [data.tree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.tree/vignettes/data.tree.html) to handle all of that, freeing you from a lot of recursive list construction.

[Click here](https://adeelk93.github.io/collapsibleTree/) to see an interactive version of the chart below.

``` r
library(collapsibleTree)

collapsibleTree(warpbreaks, c("wool", "tension", "breaks"))
```

The color of each node can be customized to draw attention to the levels of hierarchy. Thanks to Ryan Derickson for the implementation idea! Colors can be constants or generated from a gradient function.

``` r
# Data from US Forest Service DataMart
species <- read.csv("https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/CSV/REF_SPECIES_GROUP.csv")

collapsibleTree(
  species,
  hierarchy = c("REGION", "CLASS", "NAME"), 
  fill = c(
    # The root
    "seashell",
    # Unique regions
    rep("brown", length(unique(species$REGION))),
    # Unique classes per region
    rep("khaki", length(unique(paste(species$REGION, species$CLASS)))),
    # Unique names per region
    rep("forestgreen", length(unique(paste(species$NAME, species$REGION))))
  )
)
```

Gradients can be mapped to a column in the data frame to help visualize relative weightings of nodes.

``` r
collapsibleTreeSummary(
  warpbreaks,
  c("wool", "tension", "breaks"),
  attribute = "breaks",
  maxPercent = 50
)
```

An interactive Shiny demo is also included. For example, you could use the collapsibleTree htmlwidget to select a portion of a larger categorical dataset, with your filter being as deep or shallow as you'd prefer.

``` r
# Basic Shiny Interaction
shiny::runApp(paste0(system.file(package="collapsibleTree"),"/examples/02shiny"))

# Interactive Gradient Mapping
shiny::runApp(paste0(system.file(package="collapsibleTree"),"/examples/03shiny"))
```
