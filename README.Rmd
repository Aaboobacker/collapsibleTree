collapsibleTree is an R htmlwidget that allows you to create interactive collapsible Reingoldâ€“Tilford tree diagram using D3.js. Turn your data frame into a hierarchical visualization without worrying about nested lists or JSON objects!
  
If you're using Shiny, you can bind the most recently clicked node to a Shiny input, allowing for easier interaction with complex nested objects. The input will return a named list containing the most recently selected node, as well as all of its parents.
